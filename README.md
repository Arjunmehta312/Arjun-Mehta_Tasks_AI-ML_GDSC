# AI/ML Tasks - README

## Overview
This repository contains Python code for various AI/ML tasks. The tasks covered include:

1. **Even Number Sum Calculation**: A function that calculates the sum of even numbers from a user-provided list of integers.
2. **Word Frequency Counter**: A function that counts the frequency of each word in a given input text.
3. **Simple Linear Regression Model:** For predicting house prices based on square footage.

## Task Descriptions

### 1. Even Number Sum Calculation
- **File**: `even_sum.py`
- **Description**: This script prompts the user to input a list of integers and calculates the sum of even numbers from that list.

### 2. Word Frequency Counter
- **File**: `word_counter.py`
- **Description**: This script takes an input text and counts the frequency of each word (case-insensitive).

### 3. House Price Prediction (Linear Regression)
- **File**: `house_price_prediction.py`
- **Description**: A basic linear regression model that predicts house prices based on square footage. The model is trained using sample data.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the relevant task folder (e.g., `even_sum` or `word_counter`).
3. Run the corresponding Python script (e.g., `python even_sum.py`).

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (e.g., NumPy, scikit-learn)
